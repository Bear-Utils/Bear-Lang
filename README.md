<h1>Bear Lang!</h1>
<p>Very simple scripting language, to create scripts, you can either make a .txt file, or .bearL file.
There is an example script in the testingLang.txt file.
I'm still working on this. This is not complete and still needs work.
Thanks,

<h3>Running Scripts</h3>
<p>To run scripts, all you have to do is run the shell, by typing 'python3 shell.py' inside of the directory that contains the shell.py file.
 Then, once the shell has opened you should see text that says, 'Bear Lang > ', this is how you know you're in the shell. Here is where you can type RUN("NameOfYourScriptFile.txt"). Like I said before, this also works with files that have a .bearL extension.</p>
